 ## 🎧 Spotify Backend Integration

This repository contains a Node.js-based backend service that integrates with the Spotify Web API to fetch real-time playback information from a user's account.

The server handles:
- Spotify OAuth authentication flow
- Access & refresh token management
- Fetching the currently playing track
- Providing clean API responses for frontend consumption

This backend powers a live “Now Playing on Spotify” widget used in my portfolio website that dynamically displays song metadata including:
- Track name
- Artist
- Album
- Album artwork
- Playback status

### 🚀 Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Spotify Web API
- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow

### ✨ Features
- Secure token exchange and refresh handling
- Live playback status updates
- Lightweight API endpoint for frontend integration
- Deployed as a public service for real-time access

### 📌 Use Case
Built specifically to showcase real-time Spotify integration in a developer portfolio while demonstrating:
- Backend API design
- OAuth implementation
- API data handling
- Frontend + backend integration
